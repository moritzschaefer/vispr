# Testing

There are two ways to test VISPR.

## I have a working Python installation

Open a terminal in this directory and issue

    python setup.py test

If you can choose, use Python 3 for VISPR, because it will be faster.

# I don't have a working Python installation

Install miniconda for Python 3.4 from here:
http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html

Then, open a terminal in this directory and issue

    conda install --file conda.txt

to install all required packages.
Then, follow the procedure described under
"I have a working Pyhton installation".
